\begin{abstract}
The SKA is a major international project which will generate transformational science in the realm of metre and centimetre astronomy. It can be described as a ``software telescope'', with RF signals being digitized directly and generating aggregated data rates of up to ~1.7 Petabits/sec from the antennas, and intermediate data rates in the signal chain of ~5 Terabits/sec. The telescope is being designed by 10 pre-construction consortia with input from around 250 institutes world-wide and will enter the construction phase in 2019. The consortia are estimating that the computing software and hardware construction costs are both in the \euro80-90M range. 

Many of these numbers are unprecedented in astronomy and this has led to much soul searching. In 2016 the SKA Organization, which coordinates the design consortia, has used software quality, in all its forms, as a way of rationalizing key design decisions and defining primary project processes. Whilst most of this could be seen as being based on best practices elsewhere in the software industry, it has brought a number of fresh perspectives that have not been actively explored in many astronomy projects. The author will present some of these perspectives and how they, along with project risk, are seen as the primary drivers of the software processes and design.

\section{Introduction and warning}
I have decided break all the rules and write this paper in a chatty first-person style rather than a formal third person style because it reflects a personal journey over 18 months rather than reporting anything that is new and ground-breaking. Some of the assertions may be provocative but I hope that they are interpreted in the way they are intended - to contribute to debate and understanding - rather any offense being taken. In my defence, whilst what I have to say may be well understood in some communities, I don't believe it is understood by everyone in the astronomical software community and it is unlikely that all aspects of the puzzle can be seen together. It also reflects a view of the top-level status of SKA software development at this point in time, and so this, in itself, also has merit.

\section{What is the problem?}
In my experience, the senior management of large projects mostly comprise people who have limited software management experience. The systems they have experience with typically have limited modifiability requirements after a their construction period and so the processes they are familiar with don't emphasis flexibility in this area. There is nothing wrong with this per se, but it does provide a barrier that software managers, who normally have contrary requirements, have to overcome. On the other hand, software managers struggle to communicate their message, and hence there is an underlying tension that is difficult to overcome. In all honesty, we may also do ourselves no favours at times when we fail to communicate in a language that our senior managers understand, or our ideas may be poorly formed - knowing the current situation is far from ideal, but not being about to convincingly describe something which is demonstrably better.

I encountered a similar situation when I arrived at the SKA. There was, and still is, a large emphasis on documentation based earned value milestones, and in some areas of software individuals were working on documentation that they knew was irrelevant because of recent design changes, but still had to be completed to meet some earned value milestone. In fact, whilst I never posed it in this way, I am sure if I asked them where what they were doing related to the Agile Manifesto\cite{agile} they would have concluded they were on the wrong side of each of the four value statements in the manifesto. In fact, this was so entrenched that you could argue we still in this position, but I now believe there is some light at the end of the tunnel.

\section{How did we get here?}
When I look back at the management of large ground-based astronomy projects I feel that a pivotal time was in the late 1980's and early 1990's when the first 8-10m class optical telescopes were built. At that time I remember instruments transitioned from relatively small systems that could be built by a university to large systems that needed significant project and system management. As a result there were a number of failures and consequently we changed had to change our development processes to one better suited to these larger systems.

Since then, I believe that there has been a revolution in software development methods that has led to commercial companies, such as Google, Amazon and the like, being able to consistently build huge software systems that are continually evolving whilst still maintaining a high level of quality. In doing this they have overcome the issues that Conway highlighted in his most famous for his law ``organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations''. The most interesting thing I think about this paper is not the law, but his conclusion, two paragraphs later: ``Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible. There is need for a philosophy of system design management which is not based on the assumption that adding manpower simply adds to productivity.''

To a certain extent the Astronomical software community has been aware of all of this, but at another level we find we are working in projects that often inherit processes and methods that feel more 1980's than modern day. The SKA Organization is not atypical of this in that software was under-represented at various points in the planning cycle and pre-construction has been about working to develop a set of defined deliverables with nominally fixed phase gates. This paper is about how we have tried to overcome this and build a set of software development processes that will deliver the sort of software our customers will love.

\section{What did I do about it?}
After arriving at the SKA I spent some time trying to understand what the most important aspect of my role was to be. 

\section{What is quality?}
To understand quality, you need to know what it is. If you ask a software user they can easily describe it by the inverse of some of their experiences - words such as inflexible, fragile, overly complicated, difficult to understand, unpredictable and slow spring to mind. More seriously, the International Standards Organisation have written a standard on it where it describes quality in terms of "quality in use" model and a "product quality" model \citep[See][]{iso25010} \cite{ior}.
